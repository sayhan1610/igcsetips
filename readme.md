# Tips for IGCSE Success

## 1. **Understand Your Syllabus**

- **Finish Early:** Complete your syllabus well ahead of time. Don’t wait until the exams are near.
- **Mock Exams:** Take as many mock exams as possible to get used to the format and timing.
- **Past Papers:** Do past papers from at least the last 5 years. This helps you understand the types of questions and their patterns.
